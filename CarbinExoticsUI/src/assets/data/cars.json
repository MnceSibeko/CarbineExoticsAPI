  "car_About": "V10 naturally aspirated engine: power comes from the heart.It will grab the attention of your eyes and ears – the character of the Audi R8 Spyder V10 performance quattro is sharpened by unbridled power: the 5.2 FSI engine provides a maximum of 560 Nm of torque at 6500 rpm. Thanks to the dry sump lubrication, the mid-positioned engine has a particularly low installation position. In turn, this has a major influence on how precisely you can steer the R8 in any situation. The special ignition sequence for the 10 cylinders finally turns into an utterly characteristic sound: a throaty hissing and roaring noise. It'll be the soundtrack of your driving, particularly if you have the top down.",
